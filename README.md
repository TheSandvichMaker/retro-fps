# retro-fps

A retro-inspired first person game that is very much work in progress. Written from scratch in C11, using D3D11.

# How to build
Run build.bat from the x64 developer command prompt, optionally with one of the following arguments:  
```
build -release    // build release configuration  
build -all        // build debug and release configuration  
```
  
By default, it only builds the debug configuration.
